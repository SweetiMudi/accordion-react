    question : 'Where Do Permanently Deleted Files Go In Computers?',
    answer : ' Nowhere, it is still there.',
    explaination :' your computer doesn’t delete anything, they are right there in your hard disk.When you delete a file, you just change a pointer to the new address on your hard disk. Pointers are a special type of data that points to the location (Track/Cylinder/Sector of the hard drive) where the actual file is stored. Large files are usually stored in multiple locations. When you open a file, the hard drive follows the pointer to present the data.The file is never erased; it is present physically on your hard disk. But the address where the file is located is made available for the next read or write operation.',
